# Musician Match
    
        

<a name="description"></a>
## Description  
    
We were motivated to make this project by the lack of a good app for musicians to meet eachother..<br>
This app will prevent people from having to meet strangers off craigslist.<br>
We learned about a variety of third party NPM's, as well as going more in depth with React.js, GraphQL, and Apollo Server..<br>
